Hackathon topic: The most hilariously useless app/ website! How fun:)

Project summary: 
UoE has been dropping in world uni rankings, WHY? Cuz students are miserable sobs :(
We have created a solution for this - an AI homework Assistant that solved this tormenting problem for you.
But does the website actually do what it seems to do? Hmm... sus... 
Go on and upload your homework file! Hopefully it helps!
